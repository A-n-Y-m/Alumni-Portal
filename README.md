# Alumni-Portal
This is a mini project assigned to me in the 3rd SEM of MCA.

If it's about Connecting with an Alumni, Reminiscing about the past or to look forward for an event then this website handles it all!
This website was built keeping three types of user in mind:
1. Students (registered): Can view every content in the website
2. Editor (registered): Has an additional privilage to launch and edit the events
3. Students (un-registered): Cannot use the search Alumni facility
